    <title>How to Play Guitar</title>

<body>
    <div>
        <h1>Why the guitar?</h1>
            <p>Anyone with any sense knows full well that the guitar the <strong>King</strong> of all instruments. Anyone who's been told any differently needs new friends. That is, until you start playing the guitar - then you won't have any friends, because you'll be devoting all your time to practicing on the <strong>King</strong> of all intruments</p>
    </div>
    <h2>What you need</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Do you have a a full set of fingers? Good. That's all you need, that and a really expensive guitar. You'll never sound good without one. Anyone who tells you any differently.....please see above for details.
            </p>

    <h3>How to practice</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Many would tell you that you need to start with some basic scales or chords. That thinking is incorrect. The most important thing is to perfect your power stance. It's really important to have a large mirror on hand to check your form. After all, the only really important thing about playing the guitar is looking cool. I suggest 2-4 hours of solid posing a day. Then before you know it, Slash will be sending you hate mail when he starts wondering why all the kids want to emulate you and not him.</p>
